## Key Features & Custom Overrides

### 📄 Employee CV Management
- **Upload CV/Resume**: Employees can upload a PDF or DOCX file (up to 2.5MB) directly from their "My Profile" tab. Files are securely converted to Base64 and stored in MongoDB.
- **HR Viewing & Downloading**: HR managers can select any employee and view their CV in a new window or download it via a dedicated download icon.

### 🕒 Attendance Overrides & Auditing
- **Force Clock Out (Scenario 1)**: If an employee forgot to clock out or had a power outage, HR can force log them out and choose a check-out time.
- **Add Missed Logs (Scenario 2)**: HR can manually create attendance records date-wise for employees who forgot to clock in.
- **Recalculations**: Modifying check-in or check-out times triggers an automatic recalculation of working hours, breaks, and extra/less hours based on the system standard workday settings.
- **Audit Trails**: Every manual override or force logout sets the record to `adjusted`, storing who made the change (`adjustedBy`) and the reason for it (`adjustedReason`).
